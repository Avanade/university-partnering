| Carbon Analysis with Volvo | A case study on Volvo Cars to see how green SW in Volvo could reduce carbon emissions generated in online sales. The hypothesis is that if we could reduce carbon emissions in each transactions the large volume would generate a great impact. We would also like to understand how (Data AI) predictions can be used to to give fact based information's for decisions. A prototype to measure the carbon emissions related to software, as well as a dashboard to visualise this. | Samuel Lubrano, Ramit Bag, Junzhang Li, Tianxiang Xiong                                          | [Project Website](https://students.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2022/group22/index.html) |
| ItchyAI                    | Our goal for this project is to develop a machine learning system that can detect when a person with quadriplegia is experiencing an itch on their face.
